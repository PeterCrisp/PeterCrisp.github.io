[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"DNA methylation can contribute to the maintenance of genome integrity and regulation of gene expression. In most situations, DNA methylation patterns are inherited quite stably. However, changes in DNA methylation can occur at some loci as a result of tissue culture resulting in somaclonal variation. To investigate heritable epigenetic changes as a consequence of tissue culture, a sequence-capture bisulfite sequencing approach was implemented to monitor context-specific DNA methylation patterns in ~15Mb of the maize genome for a population of plants that had been regenerated from tissue culture. Plants that have been regenerated from tissue culture exhibit gains and losses of DNA methylation at a subset of genomic regions. There was evidence for a high rate of homozygous changes to DNA methylation levels that occur consistently in multiple independent tissue culture lines suggesting that some loci are either targeted or hotspots for epigenetic variation. The consistent changes inherited following tissue culture include both gains and losses of DNA methylation and can affect CG, CHG or both contexts within a region. Only a subset of the tissue culture changes observed in callus plants are observed in the primary regnerants but the majority of DNA methylation changes present in primary regenerants are passed onto offspring. This study provides insights into the susceptibility of some loci and potential mechanisms that could contribute to altered DNA methylation and epigenetic state that occur during tissue culture in plant species.\n\nGenetics Paper \nGenetics Blog Post ","date":1461733200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461733200,"objectID":"80be3c9fcc86014efab0cec0f14957f6","permalink":"https://PeterCrisp.github.io/project/deep-learning/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/deep-learning/","section":"project","summary":"Heritable epigenomic changes in DNA methylation resulting from tissue culture in maize.","tags":null,"title":"Tissue Culture","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461733200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461733200,"objectID":"553a94c5dfd3b8b099d8a12b2d248093","permalink":"https://PeterCrisp.github.io/project/example-external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/example-external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["GA Cushen"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1441083600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441083600,"objectID":"5cec0ce6e082b377c504bc66cdf990c5","permalink":"https://PeterCrisp.github.io/publication/person-re-identification/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/person-re-identification/","section":"publication","summary":"Person re-identification is a critical security task for recognizing a person across spatially disjoint sensors. Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":null,"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372654800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372654800,"objectID":"caae70970030052c8f733b2ca8421a2b","permalink":"https://PeterCrisp.github.io/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":null,"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication"}]
